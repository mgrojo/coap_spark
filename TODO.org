* Client
- [ ] Implement timeout with -B option in client
      https://github.com/AdaCore/RecordFlux/issues/1308

- [X] Implement RFC 7252 "5.4.1. Critical/Elective"

* Server
- [X] Consider implementing server state-machine and example
  - [ ] Implement secure communications for the server
  - [ ] Implement server logic for CRUD
  - [ ] Add tests for the server
  - [ ] Make the validation profile work for the server
        either with the Workarounds package or making SPARKLib 15 to work.
