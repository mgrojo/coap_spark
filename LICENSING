CoAP_SPARK is either licensed for use under the GPLv2 (or at your option any
later version) or under the APACHE license.

You have to take into account that CoAP_SPARK depends on the dual licensed
WolfSSL library. If you have a commercial license to wolfSSL, you can choose
to use the APACHE license, otherwise, by the GPL terms, you have to license any
work using this library under the GPL license.

If you want to use this library under the Apache license without the WolfSSL
dependency, you are free to reimplement the `CoAP_SPARK.Channel` package
without WolfSSL (either removing the DTLS support or using a differently
licensed TLS library).
